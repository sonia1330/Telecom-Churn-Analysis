As the telecom industry becomes even more competitive, new subscribers are getting more expensive to acquire and current subscribers are more likely to leave (“churn out”) in their search for a better deal. It is therefore of utmost importance that telecom companies track the inevitable churn rate, identify key drivers of churn and find ways to “correct” them, in order to increase customer retention to ensure profitable growth.

The key goals of the project are to :
1) Identify key drivers of churn,
2) the ideal profile of a churned customer and
3) to offer recommendations of the steps that can be taken to reduce churn and to retain customers.


💠Key insights from this project:

a) The company has a 26.5% churn rate (1869 out of 7043 customers left), resulting in a loss of $3.68M in revenue.

b) The ideal profile of a churned customer is:
has a month-to-month contract and uses the internet and phone service.

c) 45% of churned customers are in multiple lines and needed more tech support to accommodate the issue in their lines.

d) Top 3 reasons for churn are:
i) Competitor had better devices
ii) Competitor made better offer
iii) Attitude of support person


🔷Recommendations:
A. Send out questionnaires to customers to get an idea of what they are unhappy about and what they would like and act on the feedback.
B. Research what competitors are offering and improve the company’s offer.
C. Implement loyalty programs to incentivize customers to stay. The company can offer discounts on certain packages or offer deals for one to two year contracts.
D. The company can also use customer data to make personalized offers/ upsell personalized packages.
E. Ensure proper training of support staff and regularly track their performance.
